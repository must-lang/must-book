# Types

## Primitives

Basic integer types: `u8, u16, u32, u64, i8, i16, i32, i64`

There is also `bool` type and `never` type that represents type that can
never be constructed (for example return expression has type `never`)


## Compound types

Pointer types: *T, *mut T, fn(...) -> T

Tuples: (T, U, V)

## User-defined types
